## Computational Workflow

The Alloy Design Toolkit follows a systematic 8-step computational workflow:

### 1. Define Composition Space
- **User Input Configuration**:
  - Specify elements to include in calculations
  - Define concentration ranges and step sizes for each element
  - Set temperature range and step size for calculations
  - Select phases and their fractions/compositions for analysis
  - Choose steel and Fe-alloys database (e.g., TCFE13)
  - Configure parallel processing workers based on CPU capacity
- **System Processing**:
  - Generate all composition combinations within specified ranges

### 2. Predict Retained Austenite
- **Data Import**: Imports austenite fraction and composition vs temperature from Step 1
- **Calculations**:
  - Calculate martensite start temperature (Ms) for each composition
  - Estimate retained austenite fraction after quenching

### 3. Calculate Stacking Fault Energy
- **Data Import**: Imports austenite composition vs temperature from Step 1
- **SFE Calculation**:
  - Calculate stacking fault energy (SFE) for the austenite phase at specified temperatures

### 4. Multi-Objective Optimization
- **Data Integration**: Imports results from Steps 1-3
- **Optimization Parameters**:
  - **Variables**: Alloying element content and intercritical annealing temperature
  - **Constraints**: Ms temperature, RA fraction, SFE ranges, cementite fraction, martensite fraction, processing window width (ΔT)
  - **Objectives**: Maximize strength, ductility, and processing window width (represented by Ms, RA, SFE, ΔT)
- **Algorithm**: NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II)
  - Identify Pareto-optimal solutions
  - Rank solutions by dominance and crowding distance

### 5. Precipitation Kinetics Simulation
- **TC-PRISMA Integration**: Run simulations for top-ranked alloys from Step 4
- **Kinetic Analysis**:
  - Simulate precipitation during intercritical annealing
  - Track precipitate evolution parameters:
    - Volume fraction, mean radius, nucleation rate, precipitate, and matrix composition vs time

### 6. Determine Optimal Annealing Time
- **Data Analysis**: Process precipitation kinetics results from Step 5
- **Optimization Criteria**:
  - Balance precipitate strengthening with austenite stability
  - Identify optimal annealing time based on defined objectives

### 7. Export Results
- **Comprehensive Data Export**:
  - All results saved to a structured Excel file
  - Multiple worksheets for each calculation module:
    - Composition matrix and phase fractions
    - Retained austenite predictions
    - Stacking fault energy calculations
    - Optimization results and Pareto fronts
    - Precipitation kinetics data
    - Optimal processing parameters
  - Ready for further analysis and visualization

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mah-elaraby/Alloy_design_toolkit.git
    cd Alloy_design_toolkit
    ```

3.  **Install Python Packages**: The required Python packages can be installed using pip:

## How It Works

The toolkit automates an 8-step computational workflow:

1.  **Define Composition Space**: The user specifies element concentration ranges and temperature steps.
2.  **Predict Retained Austenite**: Calculates the Martensite start temperature (Ms) and estimates the retained austenite fraction.
3.  **Calculate Stacking Fault Energy (SFE)**: Determines the SFE of the austenite phase.
4.  **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Uses the NSGA-II algorithm to find optimal alloy compositions based on user-defined objectives and constraints.
5.  **Precipitation Kinetics Simulation**: Runs TC-PRISMA to simulate precipitation during annealing for the top-ranked alloys.
6.  **Determine Optimal Annealing Time**: Analyzes precipitation kinetics to find the optimal annealing time.
7.  **Export Results**: Saves all data to a structured Excel file.

## FAQ

- **Q: Do I need a Thermo-Calc license to use this toolkit?**
  - A: Yes, a valid Thermo-Calc license with TC-Python and TC-PRISMA is required.

- **Q: Can I use a different thermodynamic database?**
  - A: Yes, the database can be changed in the `config/settings.py` file. The default is TCFE13.

- **Q: Is it possible to run calculations without the GUI?**
  - A: Yes, the core computational modules and standalone scripts in the `standalone_scripts/` directory can be used independently.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tcp_python'`**
  - **Solution**: Ensure that TC-Python is correctly installed and that the Python environment being used can find the TC-Python installation. You may need to adjust your system's `PYTHONPATH`.

- **GUI is unresponsive during calculations**
  - **Solution**: The calculations are computationally intensive and run in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive. If the GUI becomes unresponsive, it may indicate a problem with the calculation thread. Check the log for error messages.

- **Incorrect results or calculation failures**
  - **Solution**: Verify that the input parameters and element concentration ranges are valid. Check that the selected thermodynamic database supports the elements and phases being calculated.

## Performance Notes

The calculations, especially the phase calculations over a large composition space, can be time-consuming. The application utilizes parallel processing to speed up these calculations. The number of parallel workers can be configured in `config/settings.py` to match the number of available CPU cores.

## Security & Privacy

This is a local desktop application. It does not collect or transmit any personal data. All calculations are performed on the local machine.

## Accessibility (WCAG)

The GUI is built with Tkinter, which has limited accessibility features. Keyboard navigation is basic. This is a research tool and has not been optimized for WCAG compliance.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

There are no specific keyboard shortcuts implemented in the application beyond the standard Tkinter shortcuts.

## Theming

The application uses the default Tkinter theme and does not currently support custom theming or dark mode.

## Error States

Errors that occur during the workflow are displayed in the log window in the "Workflow" tab. If a critical error occurs, a message box will be displayed.
